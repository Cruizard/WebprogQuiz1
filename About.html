                <p>Depok is a landlocked city in the province of West Java, with a population of a little over 3 million(as per 2023),<br> it is quite the populated city considering it's size. As to how or why the city is named that way, pople have speculated in the past with the two most popular theories being that it is an acronym for De Eerste Protestantse Organisatie van Christenen or First Protestant Christian Organization and the other being hat the word "depok" itself comes from Sundanese meaning hermitage or abode of one living in seclusion.<br> </p>
                <p2>Due to it's strategic locatin, being in the middle of both the city of Bogor and Jakarta, Depok isn't really seen as a popular tourist spot but more of a strategic urban living area, hence the numerous amounts of real estate in the city. However, that doesn't mean that Depok doesn't have it set of special local foods and places to visit. As a matter of fact, Depok hosts a numerous amounts of places to visit with some local specialty foods to boot, so join me in this brief virtual overview as i showcase just a little bit of things you cand expect when you want to visit my beloved city where i was born and raised, Depok.  </p2>
